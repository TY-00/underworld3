"""## Underworld3 Python package
`Underworld3` is a finite element, particle-in-cell geodynamics code that produces 
mathematically self-describing models through an interface with `sympy` Underworld3 builds upon the `PETSc` 
parallel finite element and solver package, using their `petsc4py` library. 

A common pattern for building `underworld3` models is to develop python scripts in notebook-friendly form
(e.g. with `jupytext`) which are thoroughly documented through markdown descriptions. `underworld` objects 
are similarly documented so that their underlying algorithmic and mathemcical structure can be examined in 
a notebook.

`python` scripts built this way will also be compatible with `mpirun` for parallel execution.

## Documentation

The underworld documentation is in two parts: the user manual / theory manual is a hand-written document that is built from this repository automatically
from the sources in the `Jupyterbook` directory. This api documentation is autogenerated from the code and its annotations. There are two version of
each documentation package that are published online. The main (stable) branch

- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/main/index.html
- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/main_api/underworld3/index.html

The development branch has similar documentation:

- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/development/index.html
- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/development_api/underworld3/index.html


## Building / installation

Refer to the Dockerfile for uw3 build instructions.  

To install from the repository
```shell
pip install .
```

The in-place `pip` installation may be helpful for developers (after the above)

```shell
pip install -e .
```

To clean the git repository or all files ... be careful.
```shell
./clean.sh
```

## Testing and documentation

Run the `pytest` testing suite with
```shell
./test.sh
```

This API documentation is build with 
```shell
./docs.sh
```

Open `uw3_api_docs/index.html` to browse.
